# ImageCaptionGenerator
This project encompasses the development and evaluation of an advanced image captioning system that integrates deep learning techniques with attention mechanisms to generate accurate and meaningful descriptions of images. The project involves utilizing a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for sequence generation, enhanced by Bahdanau attention. The system is trained on the Flikr8k dataset, a comprehensive dataset known for its diverse and richly annotated images.<br><br>
